# JustAnotherCSS

This is just another css toolkit/framework/whateveryouwannacallit.
Built by me to learn responsive css/sass and to give my future self a nice css-basis to use in future projects.

## Usage

### CSS Import
- Download the stylesheet or use this url: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrygermany/justanothercss/master/dist/css/main.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrygermany/justanothercss/master/dist/css/main.css) 
- Save the stylesheet and link to it in your html head.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrygermany/justanothercss/master/dist/css/main.css">
```
- Now you're good to go.

### Sass integration

- Install sass [on your system](https://sass-lang.com/install).

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrygermany/justanothercss.git
cd justanothercss
```
- And then run 
```bash
sass --watch src/main.scss dist/css/main.css
```
- Now you can start modifying variables in `variables.scss` or change anything else as you want, really.


## Motivation

JustAnotherCSS is built by me, Henry Germany, to understand CSS, SASS and responsive styling in general. 

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by Tania Rascia and her beautiful [Primitive UI toolkit](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive). I learned from her
(and her awesome [blog](https://taniarascia.com)) to learn in public, so here I am.

I encourage everyone to check her out. If you're interested in modern web development, her blog is really worth your time.
